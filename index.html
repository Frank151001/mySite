    <p> Currently I'm a student of mechatronic engineer on UABC from Tijuana Baja California on Mexico, I born and raised in Tijuana and since a have conscience I had the opportunity to visit USA because Tj it's a border therefore I always got this contact with their cultures and traditions this is why in November I have a thanksgiving dinner and February my family and I watch together the Superbowl, I feel the fact that I was born on the border gave me the best of both countries allowing me to had an bicultural childhood cause even if a celebrate thanksgiving I still celebrate dia de los Muertos and if I watch the Superbowl whit my family also we got together to rosca de Reyes, I think Tijuana is not enriching on his culture or traditions like the other states from Mexico but have something special, in this case Tj shows that in the culture involve adaptability allowing more people who can enriching our city whit new culture or traditions.</p>
